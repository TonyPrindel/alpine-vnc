# About
An updated and slightly more opinionated fork of danielguerra's alpine-vnc.

Currently, this repo is nothing but a basic x11vnc+openbox session with xterm installed. 
I intend to use it as a base for personal server stuff. I will maintain it so long 
as I continue to use it, but I make no promises whatsoever beyond that.


# Usage
I haven't set up a docker page just yet. Until then you will have to build it yourself.  

Afterwards, you can run it using:

docker run -d -p 5900:5900 *image name here*

# License
danielguerra did not add a license to the original repo, so I can't add one either.
